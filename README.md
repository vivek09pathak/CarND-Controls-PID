PID Controller Project

(Note - Hi , The visualization for the simulator on my machine is available at - )

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

    Tune the PID controller hyperparameters.
    Test the result on the simulator.
    Play around with the throttle.

Rubric Points
Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.
Writeup / README
1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. Here is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.

You're reading it!
PID Controller
1. Student describes the effect of the P, I, D component of the PID algorithm in their implementation.


Discussion
1. Briefly discuss what could you do to make the implementation more robust?
